<h2>The GlassFish MBean Annotation Library (GMBAL)</h2>
<br>
Gmbal is a new library for adding GlassFish v3 AMX-compliant MBeans to
GlassFish v3 components. It may be used either as part of GlassFish v3,
or standalone for providing an MBean-based management interface to any
Java application. This is important because a number of modules that
are used in GlassFish v3 are also used independently of GlassFish (e.g.
Metro in OpenSSO).&nbsp; Because of this, Gmbal also runs on Java 5,
while GlassFish v3 requires Java 6.<br>
<br>
Available documentation for the <a href="http://java.net/projects/gmbal">gmbal project</a> includes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>An introductory presentation "<a href="GmbalPresentation.pdf">Gmbal:
Annotations for JMX</a>" which discusses the background and assumptions
of gmbal, and shows screen shots of jconsole accessing MBeans on a
version of the GlassFish ORB</li>
  <li>The functional <a href="FunctionalSpec.html">specification</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="dist/javadoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a> (generated when the project is built).<br>
